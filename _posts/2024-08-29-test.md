A particularly nasty trap is hidden in an innocent seeming provision found in most controller-processor agreements.

Article 28 of the GDPR has a lot to say about what must go into a controller-processor agreement. It kicks off with a requirement that the processor:

> "processes the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller”

In short, the very essence of a processor is that they should not be permitted to go off on a frolic of their own with the controller’s data. But what if they have to? What if they are compelled by law to do so?
